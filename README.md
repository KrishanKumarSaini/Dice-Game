# Dice Game
## Overview
In this dice matching game, players select a number from 1 to 6, representing their chosen target number. They then roll a virtual six-sided dice. If the number rolled on the dice matches the player's selected number, they earn points equivalent to the matching number. However, if the rolled number does not match the player's selection, points are deducted from their score. The game continues with the player selecting a new number and rolling the dice in subsequent rounds.
